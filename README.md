# Tensorflow-using-MNIST-Dataset
This is a Neural Network Model using MNIST Dataset from Tensorflow.
# About Tensorflow:
* Tensorflow is library used for Implementing and Deploying ML and DL models Easily.

MNIST is dataset which containes images of 0 to 9 Handwritten Images.
MNIST is Hello world code for the Machine Learning using Python.

# About Tensorboard:
* TensorFlow's visualization toolkit is known as TensorBoard.
TensorBoard provides the visualization and tooling needed for machine learning experimentation:
* Tracking and visualizing metrics such as loss and accuracy
* Visualizing the model graph (ops and layers)
* Viewing histograms of weights, biases, or other tensors as they change over time
* Projecting embeddings to a lower dimensional space
* Displaying images, text, and audio data
* Profiling TensorFlow programs
* And much more


Happy Coding :computer: :chart_with_upwards_trend:
